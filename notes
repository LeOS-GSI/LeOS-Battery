TODO for 10.0.2:
 * Remove sound (or don't include it) from notification when playing it myself
 * Request/Check for read_external_media
   Ideally upon attempt to set ringtone to one external one?
   Or keep it simple, less fine-grained?
 * Update documentation
 * lots of other little things, right?


Alarm type:
  Notification
  Alarm

Notification is the old way: Played by Android, not looped, standard audio stream
Alarm is played by the service, loops* until dismissed, uses alarm stream


* Some ringtones are set to loop (mostly alarms), but not a 100% mapping.  (Some
  non-alarms loop forever, and maybe some alarms don't.  And the looping forever
  also depends on device!)  So my best solution is to set MediaPlayer to looping,
  so all alarms treated as "alarm" type by my app are looping.  (I can't make
  looping ringtones non-looping**), but I can make non-looping ones loop.

** I technically have the option to listen to onSeekComplete, so that when the internal
  looping that I have no control over loops back to 0, I can then call stop.
  This has the disadvantage of clipping ringtones that have a few internal loops rather
  than infinite looping.  (Many ringtones are 2-4 loops naturally, which sounds good,
  and clipping them to one is wonky.)  So I think the best is to have only the two
  options (Notifiation|Alarm) without an extra (loop|no-loop) setting for alarms.
  (And there are some folks saying that on some devices onSeekComplete is never called
  for infinitiely looping sounds, so this isn't trustworthy.)






Possibly in the future:

Three tabs
"Logs", "Status", "Alarms"

Action Bar tabs, rather than pager view

NAVIGATION_MODE_TABS

Depricated in API 21, but should work well on API 11+ anyway.
